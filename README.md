Project title: Project 5 Third Party APIs

Description: For this project, I was tasked with coding a schedule app so it shows the date, colors the event boxes based on the time and saves written text to the local storage and the written text loaded back onto the page when the page is reloaded. 

First is the code that I used when loading the page. It compares the class id to the current hour to deterime the color of the text boxes.
Second, it pulls text from local storage when loading the page. If there is no text in local storage it will add empty text to the box.

The following is an image of my code and demostrates the use of jquary to identify parent and child elements and using it to send items to local storage.

Next is how I used the third party API dayJS to apply the date and time to the application.
